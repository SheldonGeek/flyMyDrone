# flyMyDrone

1) Enable Alexa Skill - Fly My Drone (I will provide url later, I am still in the process of publishing this Alexa Skill)
2) Download and install this app on your Android phone. This app will automatically connect with your Parrot mini drone through bluetooth. 
3) Once the app found your Parrot mini drone, it will show the name of the drone on the screen(screen 2). Then you click the name of the drone, it will bring you to the voice command screen (screen 3)
4) NOW, you can just talk to your Alexa device (Echo, Echo dot, etc) to fly your Parrot Mini Drone!!!
a.First, you need to say: Alexa, fly my drone. (This is will invoke the skill). 
b.Then Alexa will instruct you to say : take off. 
c.After this, you can say 8 other commands to control your drone. 
The commands you can say:
Alexa, left.
Alexa, right.
Alexa, up.
Alexa, go up.
Alexa, down.
Alexa, go down.
Alexa, land.
Alexa, take picture.

You can refer to this video to get an idea how those commands work with Alexa and drone.
